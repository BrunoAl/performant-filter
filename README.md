This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Instructions

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- CSS Modules
- SWR

## Approach

- I create an API on next to handle the filtering, so it doesn't need to run on the browser.
- I didn't put much time on the UI because styling wasn't the focus of the assignment.
